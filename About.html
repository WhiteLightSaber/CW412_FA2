      <h2 style="color: green;">How To Play Snake: Mastering A Classic:</h2>
      <p>The year was 1998. Mobile phones are just beginning to explode into popularity.</p>
      <p>But, in a time before apps and social media, what do you even use a cell phone for?</p>
      <p>Widely regarded as one of the first mobile games, Snake started out as a 1976</p>
      <p>arcade game called “Blockade.” The games popularity soared with the release of</p>
      <p>the Nokia 6110. A monochrome version of Snake was pre-loaded onto devices,</p>
      <p>slithering into the hands of millions.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2 style="color: green;">Eat. Grow. Repeat</h2>
      <p>Learning how to play Snake does not require much. All you need is a computer or</p>
      <p>smartphone, quick reaction time, and a touch of skill.</p>
      <p>In almost every rendition of classic Snake, you can only move up, down, left or right</p>
      <p>either with arrow keys or swiping on a touch screen. No matter what version you</p>
      <p>play, the snake loves to eat. Eating is literally all it does.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>You'll start each game with one green and one red square. The green square is</p>
      <p>your snake and the red is an apple. Move the snake around the screen and eat as</p>
      <p>many apples as you can until the screen is full of the snake's body.</p>
      <p>Each time an apple is eaten, the snake will grow. In the original Snake game, your</p>
      <p>snake's body will grow by one square each time it eats. However, in our version,</p>
      <p>your snake will grow by four squares for every one apple eaten! This added</p>
      <p>mechanic adds more of a challenge to the game: the longer the snake, the harder it</p>
      <p>is to control.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2 style="color: green;">How To Play Snake</h2>
      <p>There are only two rules you must follow when playing: don't hit a wall and don't</p>
      <P>bite your own tail. Crashing into a wall or your tail will end the game immediately.</P>
      <P>Your high score is calculated based on the number of squares you added to the</P>
      <P>snake. You win the game when there is no more room for your snake to grow.</P>
      <br><br>
      <h2 style="color: green;">Move Fast, Think Fast!</h2>
      <p>Not only does your snake grow longer each time it eats, it moves faster than the</p>
      <p>traditional game as well.</p>
      <p>In order to master the Coolmath Games Snake, your reaction time will be tested.</p>
      <p>This snake moves quickly, so you'll have to master reacting fast in order to turn</p>
      <p>away before you collide with the walls or tail. Those sharp turns can only be</p>
      <p>mastered by practice, so get going!</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>Moving in a zig-zag formation is a key strategy when learning how to play Snake.</p>
      <p>This movement helps control the speed of the snake while still leaving room to</p>
      <p>grow. As you zig-zag, make sure the snake is moving right up against its body. Keep</p>
      <p>gaps closed tight so you can save yourself some room in case you need to make a</p>
      <p>quick move.</p>
